# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-R-Course-Project Coursera.org, Peer-graded assignment

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project.

It was required to submit: 
1) a tidy data set created from delivered messy data (submited separately)
2) a script for data cleaning process and performing the analysis (run_analysis.R)
3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations and work that I performed to clean up the data (CodeBook.md)
